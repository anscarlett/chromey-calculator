<dt><b>Where did this project go? Google Code closure for all projects is in 2015!</b>
<dd>Please submit new issues and suggestions, monitor project activity, or contribute to it at: <a href='https://github.com/IIsi50MHz/chromey-calculator/issues'>https://github.com/IIsi50MHz/chromey-calculator/issues</a>

<dt><b>How does Cloudy Calculator work?</b>
<dd>It's mostly magic. If Cloudy Calculator can't handle a calculation, it asks Google for the result (you'll see a litte "G" to the left of those calculations).<br>
<br>
<dt><b>Why don't I see any result when I press "="?</b>
<dd>To get a result, you must press <i>Enter</i>. You can add an "=" to the end of an expression, but it is not necessary.<br>
<br>
<dt><b>What kinds of calculations is Cloudy Calculator capable of?</b>
<dd>Since Cloudy Calculator uses Google's calculator feature, it can do anything <a href='http://www.google.com/help/calculator.html'>Google calculator</a> can do. It used to handle quite a few Wolfram|Alpha queries but Wolfram asked us to remove support for that.<br>
<br>
<dt><b>What kinds of names are allowed for user variables?</b>
<dd>User variables must start with an "@" sign followed by one or more letters, numbers, or underscores. The "@" variable is reserved for storing the most recent result.<br>
<br>
<dt><b>Why the name change from "Chromey" to "Cloudy"?</b>
<dd>Google made us change it.
